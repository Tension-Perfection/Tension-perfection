I've noticed a few things already  ¬DUDE you're literally 11 you CANNOT be talking about me inappropriately / negatively like that.. I don't wanna seem mean but what if it is mean, I mean what you did was painful than words can explain.. but what you did was unforgivable, focus on your education instead of making yourself look like someone who spreads misinformation I mean you are but yeah still
